# Mental Fitness Tracker
### Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flask, Machine Learning
The Mental Health Fitness Tracker is a web application I developed during my *IBM internship* to help users monitor and improve their mental well-being. In today's busy world, it's crucial to care for our mental health, and this tool offers an easy way to track various aspects of mental fitness.
Using machine learning regression models, the application predicts a mental health fitness score based on the user's input, providing insights that can guide positive lifestyle changes. While it's a useful tool, it is not a replacement for professional mental health advice. For serious concerns, please consult a qualified mental health professional.
